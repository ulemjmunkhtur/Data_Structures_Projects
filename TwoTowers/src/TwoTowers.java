/**
 *given n uniquely sized cubic blocks, where each block has a face area (not
 * side length) of 1 to n square units. In other words, each block k has a face area of k square units
 * and a side length of âˆšk units. Your goal is simple: you want to use all n blocks to build two towers
 * such that the heights of the towers are as close as possible.
 *
 * Program utilizes SubsetIterator in order to answer these questions:
 * 1. The optimal tower height (i.e., the height of each tower if they were exactly equal in height).
 * 2. In the best possible tower configuration, the subset of blocks making up the shorter tower
 * (the taller tower would simply be the rest of the blocks).
 * 3. The height of the (shorter) tower represented by the above subset. This height should be
 * close to, but not larger than, the optimal tower height.
 * 4. The difference between the height of the best shorter tower and the optimal tower height.
 * 5. The clock time (i.e., actual real-world time) taken to solve the problem, in milliseconds. Note
 * that this duration may vary from run to run or machine to machine
